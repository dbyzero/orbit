# Orbit

## Phylosophy

The goal of Orbit is to provide a bootstraped 2D game web application to make game creation easier. We don't reinvent the wheel and code is based on solid framework as ReactJS and PixiJS.

We provide a tested flow and architecture and already configured tools, as build process or translation.

## Orbit out of the box

* A game flow with rendering and UI synchronized
* Optimized rendering (thanks to PixiJS)
* Models to manage your scene
* Basic behavior component to plug on your models
* Camera with zoom
* Translation
* Screen loader
